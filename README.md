# rock-paper-scissors

This program will be my first javascript program built from scratch. 

It will resemble the common game "rock paper scissors" and will be played from the browser console (at this point in time).

This project will demonstrate my current basic understanding of JavaScript and I will revisit this later to add a user interface.
